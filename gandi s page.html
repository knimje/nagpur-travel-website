            Also known by the names Shukravari Talao (lake) and Jumma Talao is located <br>
            near Raman Science Center. The lake which is said to be exists for more than <br>
            275 years, was established as a source of water supply by Chand Sultan, the then <br>
            ruler of Nagpur. He created the water body in the form of streams being diverted <br>
            to the Nag River, which was connected to the water reservoir and named it as <br>
            ‘Jumma Talab’. Subsequently it came to be known as ‘Shukrawari Talao’ during the<br>
            Bhonsla and British periods when the first Raghuji declared Nagpur as the capital <br>
            of his domain in 1742.

            The picturesque rectangular shaped Gandhi Sagar reservoir is now enclosed with<br>
            stonewalls and iron railings. One can also found a small island in the middle <br>
            of the lake with an attractive Shiva temple and a garden. The lake looks more <br>
            attractive in the night by the illumination of the yellow mercury light. The <br>
            lake also offers boating facility to the visitors.
